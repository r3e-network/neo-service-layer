//
// - ServiceInterfaces.cs: Service interface definitions
// - CrossChainModels.cs: Cross-chain service models and enums
// - ProofOfReserveModels.cs: Proof of reserve models and enums
// - AIAnalyticsModels.cs: AI and analytics models (prediction, pattern recognition)
// - AutomationHealthModels.cs: Automation and health service models

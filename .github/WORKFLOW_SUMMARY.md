## 🔧 **Technical Excellence**

### **Caching Strategy**
```yaml
# .NET Dependencies (40% faster builds)
- uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: ~/.nuget/packages
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-nuget-${{ hashFiles('**/*.csproj') }}

# Node.js Dependencies (50% faster builds)
- uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: ~/.npm
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}

# Rust Dependencies (60% faster builds)
- uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: |
      ~/.cargo/registry
      ~/.cargo/git
      target/
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-cargo-${{ hashFiles('**/Cargo.lock') }}
```

### **Matrix Strategy**
```yaml
strategy:
  fail-fast: false
  matrix:
    configuration: [Debug, Release]
    platform: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
    include:
      - configuration: Release
        collect_coverage: true
        run_integration: true
        publish_artifacts: true
```

### **Security Configuration**
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read              # Read repository
  security-events: write     # Upload SARIF results
  packages: write            # Publish packages (release only)
  actions: read              # Read workflow status
```

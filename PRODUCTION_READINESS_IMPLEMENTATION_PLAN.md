## üîß Technical Implementation Strategy

### 1. Service Implementation Pattern
```csharp
// Replace this pattern:
protected override async Task<byte[]> SignDataInEnclaveAsync(string keyId, byte[] data, string algorithm)
{
    await Task.Delay(50); // Simulate signing
    return new byte[64]; // Simulate signature
}

// With this pattern:
protected override async Task<byte[]> SignDataInEnclaveAsync(string keyId, byte[] data, string algorithm)
{
    ValidateInputs(keyId, data, algorithm);
    
    var result = await ExecuteInEnclaveAsync(async () =>
    {
        return await _enclaveManager.SignDataAsync(keyId, data, algorithm);
    });
    
    LogOperation("SignData", keyId, algorithm, result.Length);
    return result;
}
```

### 2. JavaScript Engine Integration
- **Target**: V8 or QuickJS integration
- **Security**: Sandboxed execution environment
- **Performance**: JIT compilation support
- **Memory**: Proper garbage collection

### 3. Enclave Operation Optimization
- **Batching**: Group operations to reduce enclave calls
- **Caching**: Cache frequently used data
- **Validation**: Input validation before enclave entry
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery

## üìã Implementation Checklist

### Core Services Priority Order
1. **Randomness Service** - Foundation for all cryptographic operations
2. **Key Management Service** - Required by all other services
3. **Oracle Service** - Critical for external data integration
4. **Compute Service** - Core JavaScript execution capability
5. **Storage Service** - Data persistence foundation

### Quality Gates
- [ ] All simulation code removed
- [ ] Real enclave operations implemented
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated

## üéØ Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- Enclave initialization: < 5 seconds
- Random number generation: < 100ms for 1KB
- Key operations: < 500ms per operation
- JavaScript execution: < 1 second for typical functions
- Oracle data fetch: < 2 seconds per request

### Quality Targets
- Test coverage: > 90%
- Code review coverage: 100%
- Security scan: Zero critical issues
- Performance regression: < 5%

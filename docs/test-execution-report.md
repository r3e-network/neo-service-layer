**Sample Coverage Rates:**
- Storage Service: 4.9% line coverage (677/13,730 lines)
- Most Services: 0.6-1.1% line coverage
- Branch Coverage: 0.1-4.1% across services

## Build Issues Identified

### Critical Compilation Errors
**Status**: 🚨 **74 BUILD ERRORS BLOCKING TEST EXECUTION**

**Primary Issues:**
1. **Missing Health Check Dependencies** (35+ errors)
   - `IHealthCheck` interface not found
   - `HealthCheckContext` missing
   - `HealthCheckResult` undefined
   - Files affected: `ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs`

2. **Namespace Resolution Issues** (25+ errors)  
   - PostgreSQL Contexts namespace missing
   - Core services namespace conflicts
   - Duplicate class definitions (`StorageStatistics`)

3. **Package Conflicts** (22 warnings)
   - Duplicate BCrypt.Net-Next package references
   - Inconsistent versioning across projects

### Affected Components
- Core Framework (`NeoServiceLayer.Core`)
- Infrastructure Persistence (`PostgreSQL` integration)
- TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) modules
- Service framework extensions

## Test Execution Results

### Successful Tests
✅ **15+ Service Tests**: Have generated coverage reports successfully
- Configuration, Storage, Backup, Notification, Health services
- Automation, Compute, EventSubscription services
- Oracle, Monitoring, KeyManagement services
- And others...

### Failed Tests
❌ **Core/Integration Tests**: Blocked by compilation errors
- Cannot execute due to build failures
- Dependencies not resolved properly
- Framework integration issues

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)
1. **🔧 Fix Health Check Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Add missing package references
   dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks
   ```

2. **📦 Resolve Package Conflicts**
   ```bash
   # Clean and restore packages
   dotnet clean
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. **🗂️ Fix Namespace Issues**
   - Resolve PostgreSQL.Contexts namespace
   - Remove duplicate class definitions
   - Update service references

### Quality Improvements (Priority 2)
1. **📈 Increase Test Coverage**
   - Current: ~1-5% coverage (unacceptable)
   - Target: >80% for critical paths
   - Target: >60% overall coverage

2. **🧪 Test Infrastructure Enhancement**
   - Implement test data builders
   - Add integration test fixtures
   - Improve test isolation

3. **⚡ Performance Testing**
   - Enable performance test execution
   - Set up benchmarking baselines
   - Implement regression testing

### Long-term Strategy (Priority 3)
1. **🔄 CI/CD Integration**
   - Fix build pipeline
   - Automated test execution
   - Coverage reporting

2. **📊 Test Monitoring**
   - Set up test metrics dashboard
   - Coverage trend tracking
   - Performance regression alerts

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)
1. **Fix compilation errors** to enable test execution
2. **Run health check validation** for core services
3. **Generate baseline coverage report** once builds succeed

### Short-term (This Week)
1. **Implement missing tests** for critical business logic
2. **Set up automated testing pipeline**
3. **Establish coverage thresholds and quality gates**

### Medium-term (This Month)
1. **Comprehensive test suite development**
2. **Performance benchmarking implementation**
3. **Security testing integration**

## Test Command Reference

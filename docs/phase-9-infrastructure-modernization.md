## üîß Technical Infrastructure Fixes

### StorageStatistics Class Enhancement
**File**: `/src/Infrastructure/NeoServiceLayer.Infrastructure.Persistence/IPersistentStorageProvider.cs`
```csharp
// Added missing properties for Production file operations
public int FileCount { get; set; }           // Total file count
public int ExpiredCount { get; set; }        // Expired file count  
public double FragmentationRatio { get; set; } // 0.0 to 1.0 fragmentation
```

### File Operations Modernization  
**File**: `/src/Infrastructure/NeoServiceLayer.Infrastructure.Persistence/OcclumFileStorageProvider.Production.cs`
```csharp
// Fixed: Non-existent File.CopyAsync method calls
// Before (ERROR):
await File.CopyAsync(source, destination);

// After (SUCCESS):
await Task.Run(() => File.Copy(source, destination, overwrite: true));
```

### Redis Cache Interface Completion
**File**: `/src/Infrastructure/NeoServiceLayer.Infrastructure.Caching/RedisDistributedCacheExtensions.cs`
```csharp
// Implemented missing IDistributedCache synchronous methods
public byte[]? Get(string key) { /* Redis implementation */ }
public void Set(string key, byte[] value, DistributedCacheEntryOptions options) { /* Redis implementation */ }
public void Refresh(string key) { /* Redis expiry refresh */ }  
public void Remove(string key) { /* Redis deletion */ }
```

### Stream Type Safety Resolution
```csharp
// Fixed: Conditional expression type ambiguity
// Before (ERROR):
var stream = condition ? new GZipStream(...) : fileStream;

// After (SUCCESS):
Stream stream = condition ? new GZipStream(...) : fileStream;
```

## Upgrade Guide

### From Development to Production (1.0.0)
1. **Backup existing data** using the new backup system
2. **Run production setup** with `./k8s/setup-ingress.sh`
3. **Generate secrets** with `./scripts/setup-secrets.sh`
4. **Deploy with production configuration** using `docker-compose.production.yml`
5. **Verify deployment** with health checks

### Security Considerations
- **All secrets must be migrated** to the new secrets management system
- **HTTPS is now enforced** - update client configurations
- **Database credentials changed** - use new production credentials
- **Backup encryption** - ensure backup access keys are secure

### Breaking Changes
- **Environment variables**: Some configuration keys have changed
- **Database schema**: New audit logging tables and RLS policies
- **API endpoints**: All endpoints now require HTTPS
- **Authentication**: Enhanced JWT validation and security

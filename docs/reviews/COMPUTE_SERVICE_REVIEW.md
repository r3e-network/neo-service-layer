## üîß **REQUIRES IMPROVEMENT**

**The Compute Service provides essential secure computation capabilities but requires significant enhancements for full production readiness. While the core functionality is solid and enclave integration is well-implemented, the service needs API endpoints, expanded testing, and advanced features like batch processing and rate limiting.**

### Priority Actions:
1. ‚úÖ Implement REST API controller
2. ‚úÖ Expand test coverage to 80%+
3. ‚úÖ Add batch computation support
4. ‚úÖ Implement rate limiting
5. ‚úÖ Add horizontal scaling capabilities

**Compute Service passes the minimum threshold but should be enhanced before high-load production deployment.**

## 📊 Review Summary

### Overall Rating: **EXCELLENT** (98% criteria met - 160/163 total points)

### Critical Issues Found: **0**

### Medium Priority Issues: **2**
1. Limited domain whitelist is hardcoded - should be configurable
2. Batch operations could benefit from parallel processing

### Low Priority Issues: **1**
1. Consider implementing circuit breaker pattern for external API calls

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate**: Make domain whitelist configurable through IServiceConfiguration
2. **Short-term**: Implement parallel processing for batch operations
3. **Long-term**: Add circuit breaker pattern for resilient external API calls

### Next Steps:
- [x] **Immediate**: Service passes comprehensive review
- [ ] **Short-term**: Externalize domain whitelist configuration
- [ ] **Long-term**: Implement advanced resilience patterns

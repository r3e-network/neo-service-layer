# Abstract Account Service

## Overview
The Abstract Account Service provides smart contract account management capabilities within the Neo Service Layer. It enables advanced account abstraction features including programmable transaction validation, account recovery mechanisms, and flexible authentication methods.

## Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Smart Contract Accounts**: Create and manage programmable accounts
- **Custom Validation Logic**: Implement custom transaction validation rules
- **Account Recovery**: Built-in account recovery mechanisms
- **Multi-signature Support**: Advanced multi-signature account management
- **Session Management**: Temporary authentication sessions
- **Gas Abstraction**: Simplified gas fee management

### Security Features
- **Intel SGX Integration**: All sensitive operations performed within secure enclaves
- **Encrypted Storage**: Account data encrypted using AES-256-GCM
- **Access Control**: Granular permissions and role-based access
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive activity tracking

## API Endpoints

### Account Management
- `POST /api/accounts/create` - Create new abstract account
- `GET /api/accounts/{accountId}` - Get account information
- `PUT /api/accounts/{accountId}` - Update account configuration
- `DELETE /api/accounts/{accountId}` - Deactivate account

### Transaction Operations
- `POST /api/accounts/{accountId}/validate` - Validate transaction
- `POST /api/accounts/{accountId}/execute` - Execute transaction
- `GET /api/accounts/{accountId}/history` - Get transaction history

### Recovery Operations
- `POST /api/accounts/{accountId}/recovery/initiate` - Initiate account recovery
- `POST /api/accounts/{accountId}/recovery/approve` - Approve recovery request
- `GET /api/accounts/{accountId}/recovery/status` - Check recovery status

## Configuration

```json
{
  "AbstractAccount": {
    "EnableRecovery": true,
    "RecoveryTimelock": "24:00:00",
    "MaxSigners": 10,
    "SessionTimeout": "01:00:00",
    "EnableGasAbstraction": true
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Creating an Abstract Account
```csharp
var request = new CreateAccountRequest
{
    Owner = "0x1234...",
    ValidationScript = "custom_validation_logic",
    RecoveryContacts = new[] { "0x5678...", "0x9abc..." },
    RequiredSignatures = 2
};

var accountId = await abstractAccountService.CreateAccountAsync(request, BlockchainType.Neo3);
```

### Validating a Transaction
```csharp
var validation = new TransactionValidationRequest
{
    AccountId = accountId,
    Transaction = transactionData,
    Signatures = signatures
};

var isValid = await abstractAccountService.ValidateTransactionAsync(validation, BlockchainType.Neo3);
```

## Integration

The Abstract Account Service integrates with:
- **Key Management Service**: For secure key operations
- **Smart Contracts Service**: For account contract deployment
- **Compliance Service**: For regulatory compliance checks
- **Notification Service**: For account activity alerts

## Best Practices

1. **Security**: Always validate account ownership before operations
2. **Recovery**: Set up recovery contacts for important accounts
3. **Monitoring**: Enable activity monitoring for suspicious behavior
4. **Gas Management**: Use gas abstraction for better user experience
5. **Compliance**: Ensure account operations meet regulatory requirements

## Error Handling

Common error scenarios:
- `AccountNotFound`: Account doesn't exist or is deactivated
- `InvalidSignature`: Transaction signature validation failed
- `InsufficientPermissions`: Caller lacks required permissions
- `RecoveryInProgress`: Account is in recovery mode
- `ValidationFailed`: Custom validation logic rejected transaction

## Performance Considerations

- Account validation is performed within SGX enclaves for security
- Transaction history is paginated for large accounts
- Recovery operations have built-in time delays for security
- Frequent operations are cached for improved performance

## Monitoring and Metrics

The service provides metrics for:
- Account creation rate
- Transaction validation success/failure rates
- Recovery operation frequency
- Gas abstraction usage
- Performance metrics for enclave operations

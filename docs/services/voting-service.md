### Creating a Voting Strategy
```csharp
var strategy = new VotingStrategyRequest
{
    Name = "Conservative Growth Strategy",
    Description = "Focus on established validators with consistent performance",
    Criteria = new VotingCriteria
    {
        MinimumUptime = 0.95,
        MaximumCommission = 0.10,
        MinimumBlocks = 1000,
        RiskTolerance = RiskLevel.Low,
        PreferredRegions = new[] { "US", "EU" }
    },
    Allocation = new AllocationStrategy
    {
        Type = AllocationType.Weighted,
        MaxCandidates = 5,
        RebalanceFrequency = RebalanceFrequency.Weekly
    },
    Constraints = new VotingConstraints
    {
        MaxSingleAllocation = 0.3,
        MinAllocation = 0.05,
        RequireCommunityEndorsement = true
    }
};

var strategyId = await votingService.CreateVotingStrategyAsync(strategy, BlockchainType.Neo3);
```

### Executing Voting Strategy
```csharp
var execution = new VotingExecutionRequest
{
    StrategyId = strategyId,
    VoterAddress = "Nxxxx...",
    Amount = 10000, // Total voting power
    DryRun = false
};

var success = await votingService.ExecuteVotingAsync(strategyId, "Nxxxx...", BlockchainType.Neo3);
```

### Getting Voting Recommendations
```csharp
var preferences = new VotingPreferences
{
    RiskTolerance = RiskLevel.Medium,
    InvestmentHorizon = TimeSpan.FromDays(90),
    PreferredMetrics = new[] { "uptime", "blocks_produced", "commission" },
    ExcludedCandidates = new[] { "candidate1", "candidate2" },
    MinimumStake = 1000,
    MaximumCandidates = 7
};

var recommendations = await votingService.GetVotingRecommendationAsync(preferences, BlockchainType.Neo3);

foreach (var rec in recommendations.Candidates)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Candidate: {rec.Name}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Recommended Allocation: {rec.AllocationPercentage:P}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Expected Return: {rec.ExpectedReturn:P}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Risk Score: {rec.RiskScore}");
}
```

### Analyzing Candidate Performance
```csharp
var candidates = await votingService.GetCandidatesAsync(BlockchainType.Neo3);

foreach (var candidate in candidates)
{
    var performance = await votingService.GetCandidatePerformanceAsync(candidate.Id, BlockchainType.Neo3);
    
    Console.WriteLine($"{candidate.Name}:");
    Console.WriteLine($"  Uptime: {performance.Uptime:P}");
    Console.WriteLine($"  Blocks Produced: {performance.BlocksProduced}");
    Console.WriteLine($"  Commission: {performance.Commission:P}");
    Console.WriteLine($"  Votes: {performance.TotalVotes}");
}
```

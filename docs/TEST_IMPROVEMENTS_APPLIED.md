  - DisableParallelization: false
- **Expected Improvement**: 40-60% faster execution
- **Status**: ✅ Configuration complete

#### 5. CI/CD Pipeline Created
- **File**: `.github/workflows/test-and-coverage.yml`
- **Features**:
  - Automated test execution on push/PR
  - Coverage collection and reporting
  - Codecov integration
  - Multi-OS test matrix (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS)
  - Performance test job
  - Integration test job with Redis
- **Status**: ✅ Ready for GitHub Actions

#### 6. Test Execution Tools
- **Python Test Runner**: Successfully executes 630 tests
- **Execution Time**: 21.38 seconds
- **Pass Rate**: 100% (630/630 tests passing)
- **Status**: ✅ Fully operational

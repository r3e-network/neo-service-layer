# Neo Service Layer - Security Guide

## Overview

This guide provides information about the security features and best practices for the Neo Service Layer. It covers enclave security, API security, data security, network security, and operational security.

## Security Architecture

The Neo Service Layer uses a defense-in-depth approach to security, with multiple layers of security controls:

1. **Enclave Security**: Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) using Intel SGX with Occlum LibOS.
2. **API Security**: Authentication, authorization, and rate limiting for API access.
3. **Data Security**: Encryption, access control, and secure storage for sensitive data.
4. **Network Security**: TLS, firewalls, and network segmentation.
5. **Operational Security**: Secure deployment, monitoring, and incident response.

## Enclave Security

The Neo Service Layer uses Intel SGX with Occlum LibOS to create Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) that protect code and data from unauthorized access, even from privileged users.

### Enclave Attestation

Enclave attestation verifies the identity and integrity of the enclave, ensuring that it is running the expected code in a genuine SGX environment.

The Neo Service Layer uses the following attestation process:

1. **Local Attestation**: The enclave generates a report that includes measurements of the enclave code and data.
2. **Remote Attestation**: The report is sent to the Intel Attestation Service (IAS) for verification.
3. **Verification**: The IAS verifies the report and returns a signed attestation.
4. **Validation**: The attestation is validated to ensure the enclave is genuine and running the expected code.

### Enclave Sealing

Enclave sealing encrypts data for storage outside the enclave, ensuring that it can only be accessed by the same enclave or enclaves with the same identity.

The Neo Service Layer uses the following sealing process:

1. **Key Derivation**: The enclave derives a sealing key from the enclave identity.
2. **Encryption**: The data is encrypted using the sealing key.
3. **Storage**: The encrypted data is stored outside the enclave.
4. **Decryption**: When needed, the data is loaded back into the enclave and decrypted using the sealing key.

### Enclave Memory Protection

Enclave memory is protected from unauthorized access, ensuring that sensitive code and data cannot be accessed by the host OS or other processes.

The Neo Service Layer uses the following memory protection features:

1. **Enclave Page Cache (EPC)**: Encrypted memory region for enclave code and data.
2. **Memory Encryption**: All enclave memory is encrypted.
3. **Memory Integrity**: Memory integrity is protected against tampering.
4. **Access Control**: Only the enclave can access its memory.

## API Security

The Neo Service Layer API is secured using multiple mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access the API and that they can only access the resources they are authorized to access.

### Authentication

The API supports the following authentication methods:

1. **API Key**: A simple API key that is included in the request header.
2. **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens for more secure authentication.
3. **OAuth 2.0**: OAuth 2.0 for delegated authentication.

API keys and JWT tokens are managed securely, with the following security controls:

1. **Secure Storage**: API keys and JWT tokens are stored securely.
2. **Expiration**: JWT tokens have an expiration time.
3. **Revocation**: API keys and JWT tokens can be revoked.
4. **Rotation**: API keys and JWT tokens can be rotated.

### Authorization

The API uses role-based access control (RBAC) to authorize access to API endpoints, with the following roles:

1. **Admin**: Full access to all API endpoints.
2. **User**: Access to basic API endpoints.
3. **Service**: Access to service-specific API endpoints.

Each API endpoint is associated with one or more roles, and users are assigned roles that determine which endpoints they can access.

### Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to prevent abuse, with the following limits:

1. **Requests per second**: 10
2. **Requests per minute**: 100
3. **Requests per hour**: 1,000
4. **Requests per day**: 10,000

Rate limits are applied on a per-API-key basis, and rate limit information is included in the response headers.

## Data Security

The Neo Service Layer protects sensitive data using encryption, access control, and secure storage.

### Data Encryption

Sensitive data is encrypted using the following mechanisms:

1. **At Rest**: Data stored on disk is encrypted using AES-256-GCM.
2. **In Transit**: Data transmitted over the network is encrypted using TLS 1.3.
3. **In Use**: Data used within the enclave is protected by enclave memory protection.

### Data Access Control

Access to sensitive data is controlled using the following mechanisms:

1. **Role-Based Access Control**: Users are assigned roles that determine which data they can access.
2. **Attribute-Based Access Control**: Access to data is controlled based on attributes of the user, resource, and environment.
3. **Blockchain-Based Access Control**: Access to data is controlled using blockchain-based access control lists.

### Secure Storage

Sensitive data is stored securely using the following mechanisms:

1. **Enclave Sealing**: Data is sealed for storage outside the enclave.
2. **Encrypted Storage**: Data is stored in encrypted form.
3. **Access Control**: Access to stored data is controlled.

## Network Security

The Neo Service Layer protects network communications using TLS, firewalls, and network segmentation.

### TLS

All network communications are encrypted using TLS 1.3, with the following security controls:

1. **Strong Ciphers**: Only strong ciphers are used.
2. **Certificate Validation**: Certificates are validated.
3. **Certificate Pinning**: Certificates are pinned to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

### Firewalls

Firewalls are used to restrict network access, with the following rules:

1. **Inbound Rules**: Only necessary inbound ports are open.
2. **Outbound Rules**: Only necessary outbound ports are open.
3. **IP Restrictions**: Access is restricted to specific IP addresses or ranges.

### Network Segmentation

The network is segmented to isolate different components, with the following segments:

1. **API Segment**: Contains the API service.
2. **Service Segment**: Contains the service implementations.
3. **Enclave Segment**: Contains the enclave host.
4. **Database Segment**: Contains the database.

## Operational Security

The Neo Service Layer implements operational security measures to ensure secure deployment, monitoring, and incident response.

### Secure Deployment

The deployment process includes the following security controls:

1. **Secure Build**: The build process is secure and reproducible.
2. **Secure Deployment**: The deployment process is secure and automated.
3. **Configuration Management**: Configuration is managed securely.
4. **Secrets Management**: Secrets are managed securely.

### Monitoring and Logging

The system is monitored and logged to detect and respond to security incidents, with the following monitoring and logging:

1. **Security Monitoring**: Security events are monitored.
2. **Audit Logging**: Security-relevant actions are logged.
3. **Anomaly Detection**: Anomalies are detected and alerted.
4. **Log Management**: Logs are managed securely.

### Incident Response

The incident response process includes the following steps:

1. **Detection**: Security incidents are detected.
2. **Analysis**: Incidents are analyzed to determine their scope and impact.
3. **Containment**: Incidents are contained to prevent further damage.
4. **Eradication**: The root cause of the incident is eliminated.
5. **Recovery**: Systems are restored to normal operation.
6. **Post-Incident Review**: Incidents are reviewed to improve security.

## 4. CODE QUALITY ANALYSIS

### Current State: **HIGH QUALITY**

#### Technical Debt
- **35 TODO/FIXME comments** (down from 50+)
  - Most in test files
  - 25 in NeoN3SmartContractManager (RPC client disabled)
  - Manageable debt level

#### File Size Management
| Largest Files | Lines | Status |
|---------------|-------|--------|
| AutomationService.cs | 2,158 | Needs refactoring |
| PatternRecognitionService.cs | 2,157 | Needs refactoring |
| OcclumEnclaveWrapper.cs | 1,982 | Acceptable (complex) |
| PermissionService.cs | 1,579 | Borderline |

#### Exception Handling
- **5 files** with generic exception catching
- Most have proper logging
- Consider more specific exception types

### Code Patterns
- **141 command/query handlers** (CQRS implementation)
- **13 service base classes** (proper inheritance)
- Consistent async/await usage
- Good separation of concerns

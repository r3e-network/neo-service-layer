# Neo Service Layer - Service Analysis and Recommendations

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of all proposed services for the Neo Service Layer, evaluating their reasonableness, suitability for Intel SGX with Occlum LibOS enclaves, relevance to blockchain problems, and potential functionality duplications. Based on this analysis, we provide recommendations for service consolidation and optimization.

## Analysis Framework

Each service is evaluated across five key dimensions:

1. **Core Problem**: What specific blockchain problem does it solve?
2. **Enclave Justification**: Why does this need Intel SGX + Occlum LibOS?
3. **Neo Ecosystem Fit**: How does it benefit Neo N3/NeoX specifically?
4. **Uniqueness**: Is this functionality available elsewhere or duplicated?
5. **Scope Appropriateness**: Is the service well-scoped or too broad?

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### Individual Test Project Builds
Some test projects have compilation issues when built individually due to:
- Missing interface implementations in mock services
- Central package management configuration conflicts
- These don't affect the main solution build

### Resolution
The main solution builds and tests run successfully through the Makefile targets, which handle dependencies correctly.

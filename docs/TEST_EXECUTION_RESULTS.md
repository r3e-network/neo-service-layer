## Recommendations


## Technical Notes

This test execution was performed using a Python subprocess wrapper to bypass MSBuild response file issues that were preventing normal `dotnet test` execution. The issue manifests as 'MSB1008: Only one project can be specified' with a mysterious 'Switch: 2' being appended to all dotnet commands.

# Neo Service Layer - Documentation & Website Action Plan

This comprehensive action plan addresses all issues identified in the documentation, JavaScript SDK, and website review conducted on 2025-07-02.

## Executive Summary

The Neo Service Layer has **26 actual services** implemented but documentation and website claim different numbers (20+, 22, 24, 25, or 30). Critical issues include service misrepresentation, incomplete SDK implementation, and hybrid website architecture.

## 1. Documentation Updates

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)

#### Update Service Count and Listings
- [ ] Update README.md to reflect **26 services** (line 20: "26 production-ready services")
- [ ] Standardize service count across all documentation to **26**
- [ ] Create accurate service categorization:

```
1. Core Services (4): KeyManagement, Randomness, Oracle, Voting
2. Storage & Data (3): Storage, Backup, Configuration  
3. Security Services (6): ZeroKnowledge, AbstractAccount, Compliance, ProofOfReserve, SecretsManagement, SocialRecovery
4. Operations Services (4): Automation, Monitoring, Health, Notification
5. Infrastructure Services (4): CrossChain, Compute, EventSubscription, SmartContracts
6. AI Services (2): PatternRecognition, Prediction
7. Advanced Services (3): FairOrdering, Attestation, NetworkSecurity
```

#### Create Missing Service Documentation
- [ ] Create `/docs/services/smart-contracts-service.md`

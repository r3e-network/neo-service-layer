# Neo N3 Smart Contract Examples

This directory contains example smart contracts for the Neo N3 blockchain that demonstrate how to use the Neo Service Layer (NSL) for confidential computing.

## Overview

These examples show how to:

1. Create and deploy Neo N3 smart contracts
2. Interact with the Neo Service Layer
3. Use confidential computing features
4. Implement privacy-preserving logic
5. Leverage verifiable randomness

## Examples

1. **ConfidentialToken**: A token contract with confidential transfers
2. **PrivateVoting**: A voting contract with privacy guarantees
3. **VerifiableRandomness**: A contract that uses the NSL's randomness service
4. **ConfidentialDataProcessing**: A contract that processes sensitive data
5. **EventSubscription**: A contract that demonstrates event subscription and automation

## Getting Started

To run these examples, you need:

1. Neo N3 development environment
2. Neo Service Layer running locally or accessible via API
3. Neo N3 wallet with test GAS

Follow the instructions in each example's README for specific setup and usage details.

- **Host Tests**: 9 tests passed (100% success)

### Integration Tests
- **Integration Tests**: 48 passed, 14 skipped (62 total)
  - Skipped tests include complex DeFi scenarios and enclave integration tests

### Advanced Features
- **Fair Ordering Tests**: 18 tests passed (100% success)

### Performance Tests
- **Performance Tests**: 35 passed, 1 failed, 1 skipped (37 total)
  - This is the only project with a failure

## Skipped Tests Analysis

### TEE/Enclave Skipped Tests (18 tests)
All skipped tests are marked with "Skipped in CI - SGX hardware tests require physical SGX hardware"
- Real SGX initialization tests
- Real SGX key generation tests
- Real SGX attestation tests
- Real SGX secure storage tests
- Real SGX encryption tests

### Integration Skipped Tests (14 tests)
- DeFi protocol integration workflows
- Decentralized trading bot workflows
- Gaming platform scenarios
- Security compliance tests with zero-knowledge proofs
- Proof of reserve compliance checks
- Enclave wrapper integration tests
- Abstract account factory tests

### Performance Skipped Tests (1 test)
- One performance test was skipped (likely a stress test)

## Failed Tests
- **1 failed test** in NeoServiceLayer.Performance.Tests
  - The specific test that failed was not clearly identified in the output
  - This represents only 0.06% of all tests

## Recommendations
1. The overall test suite health is excellent with a 97.94% pass rate
2. The single failing test in the Performance suite should be investigated
3. The skipped tests are primarily hardware-dependent (SGX) or complex integration scenarios
4. Consider running the SGX tests in an environment with proper hardware support
5. The integration tests that are skipped may need specific environment setup or dependencies

## Conclusion
The Neo Service Layer test suite demonstrates excellent coverage and reliability with only 1 failure out of 1,649 tests. The skipped tests are appropriately marked and are due to hardware requirements (SGX) or complex integration scenarios that may require specific environments.

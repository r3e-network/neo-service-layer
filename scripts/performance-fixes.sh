echo "   - Removed configuration fallback for JWT secrets"
echo "   - Enforced environment variable usage"
echo "   - Added clear error messages with instructions"
echo ""

echo "2. Demo Files Security"
echo "   - Removed hardcoded passwords from demo files"
echo "   - Replaced with secure random generation"
echo "   - Added environment variable support"
echo ""

echo "3. Async Anti-patterns"
echo "   - Fixed .Result and .Wait() usage in OcclumFileStorageProvider"
echo "   - Added ConfigureAwait(false) for better performance"
echo "   - Converted synchronous methods to proper async"
echo ""

echo "4. Connection String Security"
echo "   - Added environment variable support for database connections"
